# Parallel Analysis source

Horn’s parallel analysis (PA) is an empirical method for deciding how many components in a principal component analysis (PCA) or factors in a common factor analysis (CFA) drive the variance observed in a data set of n observations on p variables (Horn, 1965).

It is an alternative way to determine the number of factors is to compare the solution to random data with the same properties as the real data set.

Many papers have discussed this method. Both R and SAS are able to conduct this analysis.

This repo includes both R and SAS resources for the parallel analysis.

For the SAS, a white paper and an example macro source code are included. <Determining the Dimensionality of Data: A SAS® Macro for Parallel Analysis Robert I. Kabacoff, Ph.D., Management Research Group®, Portland, ME>

For the R source, multiple R-packages (i.e., paran, psych) have this parallel analysis function. Two tutorials and a R code are included in this repo.
